> Documentation on how to access information on PlayerPlus.

## Format

PlayerPlus does not really have an API. Instead, all the content it provides comes from an PHP backend.
These docs aim to document on how to parse the HTML documents retrieved from certain endpoints to use it programmatically.

All the endpoints are described under [`api`](api).

The general way on how to retrieve the documents is defined in [`requests.md`](requests.md).

## ToDo

In general, unfinished parts in the docs are marked as `ToDo`.

The following list only contains tasks for the whole documentation.

 - cover more endpoints
 - swap child-numbering for concrete classes or ids where possible
 - document needed authentication
 - document other cookies
 - check if optional fields may be omitted by server
